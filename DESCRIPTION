Description: The correlated Mk model is a continuous-time Markov chain
  that describes the evolution of two categorical characters along the
  branches of a phylogeny. Evolutionary changes in the two characters
  form a correlated Poisson process known as a common shock model. The
  mkcor package implements an expectation-maximization algorithm that
  can be used to fit the correlated Mk model to data and return parameter
  estimates and correlation coefficients, expected numbers of different 
  types of evolutionary character state transitions, and ancestral state
  reconstructions.
