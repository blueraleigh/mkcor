To compile the mkcor R package:

1) ensure that R is installed
2) open a terminal
3) cd into the directory containing this README file
4) execute the following commands:
     R CMD build .
     R CMD INSTALL mkcor_1.0.tar.gz

To get started using the package, start a new R session and type

  > library(mkcor)
  > ?mkcor

A vignette is also available

  > vignette("CorrelatedMk")

Building the vignette takes a little time and can be excluded by
invoking the build process as R CMD build --no-build-vignettes .
